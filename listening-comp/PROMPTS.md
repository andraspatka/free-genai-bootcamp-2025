# Structured data

```
I have a transcript of a youtube video (@listening-comp/transcripts ) which is presenting a general test for italian listening comprehension level A1
It is structured in the following way:
- Introduction
- First listening excercise
- Second listening excercise
- Third listening excercis
- Conclusion

Please use Amazon Bedrock with the amazon nova micro model and write the code (similar to the coding convention in the @listening-comp directory) that does the following things:
- It takes the youtube transcript as the input
- It parses the transcript to the LLM model and asks it to break it down into the above mentioned structure
