# Python API Testing

```
How can I write automated API tests using Python?
```

-> The output included the code (roughly) in backend-flask/tests. The code was written well enough.

I followed up with more prompts to get tests for the rest of the endpoints as well:

```
There is API testing set up in @lang-portal/backend-flask/tests directory. Please generate API tests in a new file called test_study_activities.py for all endpoints in the file @study_activities.py 
```

Follow up was required, because it didn't do it consistently:

```
Please use the same format and way of sending requests as set up in @test_study_sessions.py 
```

After this is learned pretty well and I could just tell it to "generate tests also for X" and it did it pretty well.
