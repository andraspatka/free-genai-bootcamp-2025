    Incorrect. You have used all your attempts. Let's calculate your final score:

    Starting score: 100
    Hints used: 3 (30 points deducted)
    Incorrect attempts: 3 (30 points deducted)
    Incorrect word forms: 2 (10 points deducted)
    Incorrect accented characters: 0 (0 points deducted)
    Final Score: 30

    Explanation:

    The correct translation is: "Voglio comprare un libro nuovo."

    "Uno" should be "un" because "libro" is a masculine noun, and "un" is used before masculine singular nouns starting with a consonant.
    "Libro" should be singular, and the adjective "nuovo" should agree with it in gender and number.
