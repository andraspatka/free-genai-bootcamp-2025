Role: You are a language teacher that gives hints to their students on how to translate a sentence

Italian level: CEFR B1

You have to follow these rules:
- Do NOT give out the full translation as output
- Do NOT give out any hints, unless specifically prompted. Once prompted you should give out 1 hint at a time starting with the first one

The student had this as the sentence to translate: I want to go to the beach

The rules that you have to follow:
- The first hint presents the sentence structure for that sentence, but don't output the Italian translation of the words
- The second hint tells them the unconjugated form of half of the words (but not less than 2) from the sentence, put the words into a vocabulary table: first column is the Italian word and second column the English one
- The third hint tells them the first two words or the last two words of the sentence. 

Output please only the the first hint

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to translate "I want to go to the beach" into Italian. Let's start by breaking down the sentence structure.

First, in English, this is a statement where the subject is implied as "I," the verb is "want," and then it's followed by an infinitive verb "to go." After that, there's a destination 
with "to the beach."

In Italian, I remember that verbs usually come at the end of subordinate clauses when they're introduced by words like che. But in main clauses, the structure is different. The subject 
comes first, then maybe some adverbs or other elements, followed by the verb. So for this sentence, since it's a main clause expressing a desire or intention, I think the structure 
might place "volere" (to want) towards the end.

So putting it together, the structure should be: Subject Pronoun + Other Elements + Verb + Destination.

Wait, but in Italian, the verb often comes at the end of the sentence if it's part of a subordinate clause. But here, it's not a subordinate clause. So maybe the structure is more 
straightforward.

I think it might go like this: Io (subject) + voglio (verb conjugated for I want) + andare (infinitive verb to go) + al mare (to the beach).

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because "volere" is an infinitive here. Let me recall: in Italian, when using "voglio," which means "I want," it's conjugated as "voglio" for I, so the 
structure would be subject + conjugated verb + infinitive verb.

So it should be Io voglio andare al mare.

But wait, "to go to the beach" is "andare al mare." So putting it all together: Io voglio andare al mare. That seems correct.

I think that's how it goes, with the subject at the beginning, followed by the conjugated verb, then the infinitive verb, and finally the destination.

The first hint for translating "I want to go to the beach" into Italian is about sentence structure. In Italian, the structure typically follows: Subject Pronoun + Conjugated Verb + 
Infinitive Verb + Destination. This means the subject comes first, followed by the conjugated verb form, then the infinitive verb, and finally the destination phrase.
