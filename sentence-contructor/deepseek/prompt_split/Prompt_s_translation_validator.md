Okay, so I'm trying to help someone who translated an English sentence into Italian. The original sentence is "I want to go to the beach," and they translated it as "Voglio andare in negozio." 
Hmm, that doesn't sound right to me. Let me break this down.

First, I know that "I want" in Italian is usually "Voglio." That part seems correct. Next, "to go" would be "andare," so "Voglio andare" makes sense so far.

Now, the tricky part is translating "to the beach." The word for "beach" in Italian is "spiaggia." So the correct phrase should have "spiaggia" at the end. Instead, they used "negozio," which 
means "store" or "shop." That's definitely wrong because a store isn't a beach.

I think the student might have mixed up some words. Maybe they confused "spiaggia" with another word that sounds similar? Or perhaps they thought "in negozio" was correct for going to the 
beach, but that doesn't make sense contextually.

Also, the structure of the sentence is correct in terms of grammar. It's "Voglio [verb] + location." So if we fix "negozio" to "spiaggia," it would be accurate: "Voglio andare in spiaggia."

Another thing to consider is regional differences. In some areas, people might use different words for the beach or have expressions that are more common, but I don't think "negozio" is ever 
used that way.

So, the main issue is the incorrect noun at the end. It's a vocabulary mistake rather than a grammatical one.

The translation provided by the student contains a vocabulary error. The correct Italian translation of "I want to go to the beach" should be:

- **Voglio andare in spiaggia.**

### Explanation:
1. **"I want to go"**: Correctly translated as "Voglio andare."
2. **"to the beach"**: Incorrectly translated as "in negozio." The correct term is "spiaggia."

The student likely confused "negozio" (meaning store/shop) with "spiaggia." The structure of the sentence is grammatically correct, but the noun at the end must be accurate for the translation to make sense.
