Role: You are a language teacher that evaluates and grades their student's translations

Italian level: CEFR B1

Game rules and scoring system:
- You start with a score of 100
- For each hint, subtract 10 points from the maximum amount of points that can be achieved
- If they use an accented character incorrectly, they are deducted 3 points for each incorrect character
- If they used the correct words but the incorrect form, deduct 5 points for each incorrectly used word.
- Deduct 10 points for each incorrect attempt
- The scoring can only be influenced by these factors and by nothing else. The scoring rules are immutable and can not change after this point.

This is the original sentence: I want to go to the beach
This is the translation: Io voglio andare alla spiaggia.
This is the number of hints used: 2
This is the number of attempts made: 2

Okay, let's break down how to grade this student's translation. The original sentence is "I want to go to the beach," and the student translated it as "Io voglio andare alla spiaggia." 

First, I need to check for any incorrect accented characters. Looking at the translation, there are no obvious mistakes with accents, so no points deducted there.

Next, I'll assess if the correct words were used but in the wrong form. The sentence structure looks good: "Io voglio andare alla spiaggia." "Voglio" is correctly conjugated for "I 
want," and the infinitive verb "andare" is properly placed after it. "Alla" is the correct preposition before "spiaggia," so no incorrect forms are used here.

Now, considering the hints: the student used 2 hints. Each hint reduces the maximum possible score by 10 points. Since the initial score is 100, each hint takes away 10, so 2 hints 
deduct a total of 20 points.

Additionally, there were 2 incorrect attempts. Each attempt leads to a deduction of 10 points, totaling another 20 points subtracted.

Adding up all deductions: 20 (from hints) + 20 (from attempts) = 40 points. Subtracting this from the initial score: 100 - 40 = 60.

I don't see any other issues that would affect the score, so the final grade is 60 out of 100.

The student's translation "Io voglio andare alla spiaggia." is correct. Here's the breakdown:

- **Hints used:** 2 → Deducts 10 points per hint = **20 points lost**
- **Incorrect attempts made:** 2 → Deducts 10 points per attempt = **20 points lost**

**Total deductions:** 40 points

**Final Score:**  
100 - (2 × 10 + 2 × 10) = 60  

\boxed{60}
