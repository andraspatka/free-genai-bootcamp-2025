# Atomic Agents Examples

The goal is to reimplement the Song vocabulary agent from: https://gist.github.com/kajogo777/df1dba7f346d3997c38ec0261422cd81

Using either a framework or implementing everything from scratch.

## Framework

Atomic agents has gotten a lot of love lately, as it aims to be simple and developer friendly.
There have been a lot of criticism surrounding langchain as their implementation seem to be convoluted and hard to understand.

Atomic agents seems to have been created as an answer to difficult to understand frameworks.
